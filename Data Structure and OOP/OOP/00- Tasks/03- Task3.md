# Class Date

## Objective:
Create a class named `Date` that represents a date with attributes such as day, month, and year. Implement methods to set and get these attributes, and perform operations such as subtracting dates and printing dates.

## Requirements:

### Date Class:

1. **Member Variables:**
   - `day`: Integer representing the day of the date.
   - `month`: Integer representing the month of the date.
   - `year`: Integer representing the year of the date.

2. **Constructors:**
   - Implement a parameterized constructor that takes `day`, `month`, and `year` as parameters and initializes the corresponding data members.

3. **Setter and Getter Methods:**
   - Implement setter methods (`setDay`, `setMonth`, `setYear`) to set the values of the data members.
   - Implement getter methods (`getDay`, `getMonth`, `getYear`) to return the values of the data members.

4. **Functions:**
   - `subtractDate(Date d) -> int`: Calculates the difference in days between two dates (`D1.subtractDate(D2)`).
   - `printDate()`: Prints the date in the format "day/month/year".

## Example Usage:

Given Dates:
- Date 1: 20/6/2018
- Date 2: 21/7/2019

Calculate the difference between these two dates in days.
