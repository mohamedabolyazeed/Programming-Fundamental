# Simple Student Management System
## Objective:
- Create a class named Student that represents a student with attributes such as name, age, and grade. Implement methods to set and get these attributes, and display the student's details.

## Requirements:
Student Class:

    1. Create a class named Student.
     Add private data members for name (String), age (int), and grade (double).  

    2. Implement a default constructor that initializes the name to an empty string, age to 0, and grade to 0.0.  

    3. Implement a parameterized constructor that takes name, age, and grade as parameters and initializes the corresponding data members.  

    4. Implement a Copy constructor that takes name, age as parameters and initializes the corresponding data members.  

    5. Implement setter methods (setName, setAge, setGrade) to set the values of the data members.  

    6. Implement getter methods (getName, getAge, getGrade) to return the values of the data members.  

    7. Implement a printDetails method to display the student's details.
    Main Class:

    8. In the main method, create two instances of the Student class using both the default and parameterized constructors.  

    9. Set the values of the attributes for the first student using the setter methods.  
    
    10. Display the details of both students using the printDetails method.
