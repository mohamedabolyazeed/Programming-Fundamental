# Task: Multilevel Inheritance

## Objective

Create a complex  program to demonstrate multilevel inheritance involving a hierarchy of classes. The base class will be `Person`, followed by a derived class `Employee`, and then further derived classes `Manager` and `Engineer`. This task will illustrate advanced use of constructors, method overriding, and additional properties at each level.

## Instructions

### Base Class: Person

- **Properties**:
  - `name` (string)
  - `age` (int)
- **Methods**:
  - `displayInfo()`: A virtual function to display basic information about the person.

### Derived Class: Employee (inherits from Person)

- **Additional Properties**:
  - `employeeID` (int)
  - `department` (string)
- **Methods**:
  - Override `displayInfo()` to include employee-specific information.
  - Add a new method `showDepartment()` to display the department of the employee.

### Further Derived Class: Manager (inherits from Employee)

- **Additional Properties**:
  - `numTeams` (int)
- **Methods**:
  - Override `displayInfo()` to include manager-specific information.
  - Add a new method `showTeams()` to display the number of teams managed.

### Further Derived Class: Engineer (inherits from Employee)

- **Additional Properties**:
  - `specialization` (string)
- **Methods**:
  - Override `displayInfo()` to include engineer-specific information.
  - Add a new method `showSpecialization()` to display the engineer's specialization.

### Main Function

1. Create objects of `Manager` and `Engineer`.
2. Call `displayInfo()` and other specific methods to demonstrate the functionality of multilevel inheritance.
