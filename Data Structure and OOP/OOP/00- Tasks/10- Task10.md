# Task : Hierarchical Types

## Objective

Create a  program that demonstrates inheritance by defining a base class `Vehicle` and two derived classes `Car` and `Bike`. The program should showcase the use of polymorphism through a virtual function `displayInfo()`.

## Instructions

1. **Base Class: Vehicle**
   - Properties: `brand` (string), `model` (string)
   - Virtual Function: `displayInfo()`

2. **Derived Class: Car**
   - Additional Property: `numDoors` (int)
   - Override the `displayInfo()` function to display information specific to the car.

3. **Derived Class: Bike**
   - Additional Property: `numGears` (int)
   - Override the `displayInfo()` function to display information specific to the bike.

4. **Main Function**
   - Create objects of both `Car` and `Bike`.
   - Call the `displayInfo()` function for each object to demonstrate polymorphism.
