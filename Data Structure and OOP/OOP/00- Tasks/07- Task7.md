# Task: Create a Calculator Class with Overloaded Methods

## Objective
Create a Java class named `Calculator` that demonstrates method overloading by implementing multiple methods with the same name but different parameter lists to perform arithmetic operations.

## Requirements

### Calculator Class

- Create a class named `Calculator`.
- Implement four overloaded methods named `add` to perform addition:
  1. `add` with two integer parameters, returning the sum of the two integers.
  2. `add` with three double parameters, returning the sum of the three doubles.
  3. `add` with an array of integers as a parameter, returning the sum of all integers in the array.
  4. `add` with an array of doubles as a parameter, returning the sum of all doubles in the array.

### Main Class

- In the `main` method, create an instance of the `Calculator` class.
- Call each `add` method with appropriate arguments and display the result.

### Knowledge requirements
- overloading methods
