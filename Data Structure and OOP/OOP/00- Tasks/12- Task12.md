# Task:  Multiple Inheritance

## Objective

Create a complex  program to demonstrate multiple inheritance involving a hierarchy of classes. The base classes will be `Person` and `Worker`, followed by a derived class `Employee` that inherits from both `Person` and `Worker`. Further derived classes `Manager` and `Engineer` will inherit from `Employee`. This task will illustrate advanced use of constructors, method overriding, and handling potential issues related to multiple inheritance, such as ambiguity.

## Instructions

### Base Class: Person

- **Properties**:
  - `name` (string)
  - `age` (int)
- **Methods**:
  - `displayPersonInfo()`: A function to display basic information about the person.

### Base Class: Worker

- **Properties**:
  - `workerID` (int)
  - `role` (string)
- **Methods**:
  - `displayWorkerInfo()`: A function to display basic information about the worker.

### Derived Class: Employee (inherits from Person and Worker)

- **Additional Properties**:
  - `employeeID` (int)
  - `department` (string)
- **Methods**:
  - Override `displayPersonInfo()` and `displayWorkerInfo()` to include employee-specific information.
  - Add a new method `showDepartment()` to display the department of the employee.
  - Add a new method `displayInfo()` to display combined information from both base classes.

### Further Derived Class: Manager (inherits from Employee)

- **Additional Properties**:
  - `numTeams` (int)
- **Methods**:
  - Override `displayInfo()` to include manager-specific information.
  - Add a new method `showTeams()` to display the number of teams managed.

### Further Derived Class: Engineer (inherits from Employee)

- **Additional Properties**:
  - `specialization` (string)
- **Methods**:
  - Override `displayInfo()` to include engineer-specific information.
  - Add a new method `showSpecialization()` to display the engineer's specialization.

### Main Function

1. Create objects of `Manager` and `Engineer`.
2. Call `displayInfo()` and other specific methods to demonstrate the functionality of multiple inheritance.
