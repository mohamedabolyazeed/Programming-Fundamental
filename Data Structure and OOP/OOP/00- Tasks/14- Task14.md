# Task: Advanced Static Usage 

## Objective
Explore advanced uses of static by creating a class that demonstrates static methods, static members, and static blocks in combination with inheritance and polymorphism.

## Requirements

1. Create a base class called `Shape` with a static variable `counter` initialized to 0, a static method `getCounter` that returns the value of `counter`, and an instance method `draw` that prints "Drawing a shape".

2. Create two subclasses of `Shape` called `Circle` and `Rectangle`. Each subclass should have its own static variable `counter` initialized to 0, and should override the `draw` method to print "Drawing a circle" or "Drawing a rectangle" respectively. Additionally, each subclass should have a static method `getCounter` that returns the value of its `counter`.

3. In the `main` method of another class, demonstrate the use of the `Shape`, `Circle`, and `Rectangle` classes by:
   - Creating multiple instances of `Shape`, `Circle`, and `Rectangle`.
   - Calling the `draw` method on each instance and observing the output.
   - Calling the `getCounter` method on each class and observing the output.
