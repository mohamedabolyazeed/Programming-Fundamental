# ðŸŒŸ Math Operators in Python ðŸŒŸ

# This table shows the different mathematical operators in Python.
# The `operator` column shows the symbol used for the operator.
# The `operation` column describes the operation performed by the operator.
# The `Example` column shows an example of how the operator is used.
# The `Evaluates to` column shows the result of the operation.

# For example, the addition operator `+` adds two numbers together.
# The example `2 + 2` evaluates to `4`.

# The other operators work in similar ways.

# Here is a summary of the operators:

# Operator | Operation             | Example | Evaluates to
# -------- | ----------------------- | -------- | -------------
# +        | Addition                | 2 + 2   | 4
# -        | Subtraction             | 5 - 2   | 3
# *        | Multiplication          | 3 * 5   | 15
# /        | Division                | 22 / 8  | 2.75
# //       | Integer division        | 22 // 8 | 2
# %        | Reminder                | 22 % 8  | 6
# **       | Exponent                | 2 ** 3  | 8

# ðŸ’¡ Tip: Remember that the order of operations follows PEMDAS 
# (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication/Division, Addition/Subtraction).
