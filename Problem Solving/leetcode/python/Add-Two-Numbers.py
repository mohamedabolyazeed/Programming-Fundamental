# Problem Description:
# You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers.
# The digits are stored in reverse order, and each of their nodes contains a single digit.
# Add the two numbers and return the sum as a linked list.
# You may assume the two numbers do not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.
#
# Example:
# Input: (2 -> 4 -> 3) + (5 -> 6 -> 4)
# Output: 7 -> 0 -> 8
# Explanation: 342 + 465 = 807
#
# ----------------------------
# Detailed Explanation of the Solution:
# We create a dummy node to simplify the linked list construction.
# We iterate through both input linked lists (l1 and l2) as long as there are nodes or there's a carry.
# At each step, we:
#   - Take the value from the current node of l1 and l2 (0 if the node is None).
#   - Add those values together with any carry from the previous step.
#   - Calculate the new digit (total % 10) and update carry (total // 10).
#   - Create a new node with the calculated digit and append it to the result list.
#   - Move to the next nodes in l1 and l2.
# After the loop, the dummy nodeâ€™s next pointer will point to the head of the resulting sum list.
